# Password Generator
WPF application for generating simple passwords.   
To generate a password, you must select the length of the password. There are 4 password length options: 8 characters, 10 characters, 12 characters, and 16 characters. After choosing one of the options, you must click on the "Generate" button to generate the password.   
The field in which the pair is displayed has a copy property, so you can safely highlight the password and copy it.  
Also, the password can be saved to a text file by clicking on the "Save" button.
