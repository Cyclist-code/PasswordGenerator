# Password Generator
WPF application for generating simple passwords.
To generate a password, you must select the length of the password. There are 4 password length options: 8 characters, 10 characters, 12 characters, and 16 characters. After choosing one of the options, you must click on the "Generate" button to generate the password.   
The field in which the pair is displayed has a copy property, so you can safely highlight the password and copy it.  
Also, the password can be saved to a text file by clicking on the "Save" button.
## Technologies
- C# programming language;
- .NET Framework 4.7.2.
## Architecture
The application is written using the MVVM pattern. The MVVM pattern is a pattern that helps to clearly separate the business and presentation logic of an application from it's user interface (UI). A clear separation of application logic and user interface helps solve multiple development problems and can make it easier to test, maintain, and develop an application. There are three main components in the MVVM pattern: Model, View, and View Model.
